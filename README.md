### startpage-cms
This repository is a very basic content management system for my startpage. Built with the, well...it works mindset, this repository contains the assets for the startpage whether that's backgrounds, svgs, bookmarks and search providers it's got it all. This is the CMS repo Bongo-API uses to feed the assets to Startpage.
